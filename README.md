👋 Hi there,
I’m Russian by nationality who relocated to Singapore to pursue a masters as a full-time student at Singapore Management University.
For me, it was a step towards making a global career while polishing my knowledge and building a professional skillset.

👀 During my studies, I solidify  my knowledge of financial markets and investments. Learned machine learning, deep learning and big data skills.

🌱 I have recently completed Master's in Business Analytics from Singapore Management University and looking forward to solve challenging business
problems and grow as a data scientist/ml engineer. I am technically sound in using Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, LightGBM, tensorflow, Keras),
SQL, Tableau, Advanced-excel.
